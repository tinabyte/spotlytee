# Spotlyte - HackGT Fall 2022

## Introduction 
College can be extremely challenging. Students must take every opportunity to ‘power-up’ and face these challenges to ‘level-up’. As four college students, we understand that with busy schedules making it to lectures only adds to the challenge. However missing just one lecture can be a ‘game-over’ especially when you are often missing key points in lecture, so we brainstormed a solution. From there Spotlyte was born to create a more efficient academic environment by providing students with accurate and informative notes with a retro Pac-Man twist. :)

#### Project Description
Spotlyte is a multipurpose audio, video, and text converter that can be utilized to make college life easier and potentially safer for students by utilizing machine learning algorithms and APIs.
College classes require a lot of information to be digested from lectures for students to learn; Spotlyte reduces the hassle of having to listen through long lectures and creates a summarized version of it.  Spotlyte also utilizes APIs to compress mp4 and wav instance footages from Youtube and Zoom to signal key movements and events that may signal action words. Overall, Spotlyte is capable of providing efficient summarized data to students through its conversion and detection systems revolving around APIs.
