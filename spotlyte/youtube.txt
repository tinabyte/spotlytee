one of theseokay he might be right but i'm tooinsecure to accept that so i bet himthat i could and whoever loses the bethas to paint themselves green and stayin front of all of youwhat are you doing in my swamp on cameranext thing i know i'm outside of abuilding that's probably on the cover ofa goosebumps book it didn't take long tofind the entrance and immediately beterrified by a cat waving at me as wellas a plethora of ducks why are there somany ducks here that is a super duck inervously waited for a few minutes wheni was greeted by a man named tom legallyknown as the master of senses i was thenguided to the world's largest sensorydeprivation pool i'm not scared you'rescared i feel like i walked into anotherportal at some point back there you'retelling me this isn't the most ominousstory you've ever seenbruh i'm gonna be doing the maximumlegal time in this thing three hours onewith no gravity one with no gravity orlight and one with no gravity light orsound complete sensory deprivation whichapparently can have some side effectsi'm a little scared of hallucinatinglike in a simpsons episode theyhallucinate so it must be true but firsti checked how deep the water is becausei can barely swim which tom thought washilariousand now i'm readyyaywhoasee yaso when you get into a floating poolgenerally the progression is as followsyou get in you sit down you lay back andas you lay back you float up to thesurface of the wateroh my goshi feel like a single self organism rightnow i've got a timer on my phone that'sgoing to go off at the three hour marki don't have an ex-girlfriend you guysknow i can't swim really well i can'tfloat either i am negative buoyantsomehow so these pools have tons of saltlike 2 500 pounds of salt even instranger things they show them fillingup a pool of salt and salt makes youfloat i worked really hard on thisvisual please affirm me but inconclusion it's like dropping an icecube into a glassif it's a person's first time it's goingto take maybe five to ten minutes forthem to start to release their body in away that trusts the water i have neversuccessfully floated before and this iswell this is crazyi was only 18 minutes into thischallenge when i had the actual scariestexperience of my lifeof courseyou know i would say 10 minutes to 20minutes isyou know mind dump[Music]and then maybe around 25 to 30 minutesthe mind just goes okayi give upi don't see how people fall asleepyou know this is why you don't say stufflike that i'm completely asleep heretotally uh vulnerable but the duck wokeme up and now it's time to turn off thelights[Music]turning off the lights added acompletely new element to this that igenuinely didn't expect to be thatdramatic but it was i lost all conceptsof timebut i still have my dog with me soyou know being glued to a phone or gluedto a screen i think increases you knowyour own personal suffering so i haven'teven gotten to the silence yet and ifeel so weird because i've realized ihave developed a habit of listening tosomething at all times or watchingsomething at all times like thisscreenshot is myicon is like lifearoundjust hoping to hit the corner perfectlyoh nonot quitewe are the happiest and this has beenproven in study after study when we arefully present in a momentright here right nowand the moment is not on the screenit's so echoey i feel like we're in theinside of my mind right nowand it's not a very familiar place60 to 90 minutes is enjoyable relaxingrefreshing floating longer it could bevisionary you could see either thingsthat you have seen or things that you'venot around two hours and four minutesish is where something actually crazyhappened i really feel like my mind wasthe only thing working at this point isuddenly felt like i infiltrated thismemory that i haven't thought of inyears because i felt so stillplease don't judge me when you watchthisi feel like this reminds me of when iwas little in the summer times when ididn't have to go to schoolmy grandmashe was like myshould i raise me my grandma would liketake naps todayand i hated taking naps but i washanging out with herand i just remember feeling so stillwell that's embarrassinguh but it wasrealanywaysmaxed out sensory deformationwhen you cut off sensory input to thebody it's pretty amazing right so youhave no gravity no light no sound you'rereducing the workload that your brainand central nervous system has toprocess pretty dramaticallyheyall i can hear is the noises inside myearsi fell asleep immediately hour three letme tell you about hour three it hitsdifferent okay it's like everything inthe world it's a wave it starts at acertain level you know and then you sinkdown into a deep relaxation and then themind comes back and asserts itselfahyou can tell me i've been in here for30 minutesor 10 hoursseriouslyi'm not just saying thatand now you're about to watch me reachthe threshold of hallucinationsconfusionconstipation i don't remember the fulllist but this is itif i had to explain what i was feelingin this moment or what i was seeing isbasically on screen i feel like my mindjust started creating content becausewhat even is nothing like the absence ofevery sense every thoughtmy identity on this planeteverything it was just gone for a bitthe last 20 minutes was a spiritualexperience and it took me another 10minutes to even realize my timer wasgoing offbut what i did next is the real storyherei immediately started checking mynotifications and if you heard thissound throughout this videothat's because there were 62 of them onefor every notification i missed while inthis tank and so i guess the question iswere they worth missing this thing onwhat am i supposed to say what are youdoing in my swampso that's basically just gonna pop uplet me do it one more time
